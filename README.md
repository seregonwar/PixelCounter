# PixelCounter
What you find in this repository is a simple program that aims to "Count" black and white pixels. You can find the black pixel counter inside the program`BlackPixelCounter.py`, and the white pixel counter in the file`WhitePixelCounter.py`. I don't know how useful this program could be to you since I developed it for a specific need of mine but in the end I decided to make it available to anyone who needs it, it can also be modified to simply make an image black and white by removing the part of the program that acts as a counter. That said, I hope it can help you!
